# FirstBlockchain

For this project, I followed the steps outlined in Daniel van Flymen's article on Medium.com called "Learn Blockchains By Building One"

For each method, I have added descriptive comments to demonstrate my knowledge of the programs' components and functionality. I tested the blockchain using a local server and interacted with it through Postman.
